### Hi there, I'm Beyza 👋

## I'm a computer programmer :computer:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Frontend Development and learning C/C#.
- 💬 I am a computer programming student. I love software. Tea and software are indispensable. Sometimes, even if I have a problem, I try to solve that project before I sleep until morning.
- ✌️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone with any project.
- ⚡ I spend almost 9-10 hours a day developing software.
- 📚 I think reading books is the easiest way to improve yourself.
