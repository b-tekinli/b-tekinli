### Hi there, I'm Beyza ğŸ‘‹

## I'm a computer programmer :computer:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Frontend Development and learning C/C#.
- ğŸ’¬ I am a computer programming student. I love software. Tea and software are indispensable. Sometimes, even if I have a problem, I try to solve that project before I sleep until morning.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend almost 9-10 hours software development everyday.
- ğŸ“š I think reading books is the easiest way to improve yourself.
